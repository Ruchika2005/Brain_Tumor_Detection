Brain Tumor Classification 

This project uses a VGG16-based Convolutional Neural Network to classify brain MRI images into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. The dataset contains over 7,000 MRI scans, split into training, validation, and testing sets.

Images are preprocessed (resizing, normalization) and augmented to improve accuracy. The model is trained using transfer learning with fine-tuning and evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.

The final model achieves 98% test accuracy, demonstrating strong performance in automated brain tumor detection using MRI scans.
